# My Portfolio

## Motivation

Since my old portfolio started to be hard to maintain and improve,
this is a replacement that aims to be better for this.

## Update 2024

It's been 4 years since the last update.
Now that Nuxt.js 3 released, migration seems quite complex and there are many vulnerabilities.
It's no longer easy to maintain, so I plan to make something with minimal dependencies, potentially for short blog posts.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
