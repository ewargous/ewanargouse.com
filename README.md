# Ewan Argouse Portfolio

## Motivation

Since my old portfolio started to be hard to maintain and improve,
here is a replacement that aim to be better for this.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
